# openai-stream

A small demo for streaming response with an express and React project.

Abandon the use of Vercel's AI library.

## Notes

The difference between openai-node and the AI library is that the AI library has an additional layer of encapsulation, where the content returned in a stream is just text, whereas openai-node streams back an object.

## Libraries
- openai-node
- express
- react
